# Internal-Security-Audit-Writeup
A mock internal security audit assignment done on Botium Toys, fictious toy company as part of cybersecurity portfolio project. Completed as part of Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera.

-------
Disclaimer: This activity and my results can be done in many possible ways and can differ. The importance is understanding the choices selected based on scope and expectations for the audit. 

Self-Evaluation: I did mostly well in determining what controls are top priority and need implementation immediately in reducing risk and why Botium Toys would need to comply to the regulations and standards I initially picked on my first try. I really loved the challenge of this assignment and tested what I have learned in my studies and hands-on learning.

Room for improvement: 
The part I struggled using much details in compiling all my results and findings in the stakeholder's memorandum. I spent alot of time hung up on this to try to be more concisely and to the point. I learned to use a list and ensure I didnt repeat anything and to filter out information.

I also had trouble in my explaining and tying in the System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2) standard to organizational user access policies, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety and levels of risks, not just financial compliance, while conducting the audit and spent time researching it.

## Scenario 
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework** (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department.

------------------------


_Summary: Perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs
to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The
audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are
classified as “high risk,” and present an overall strategy for improving the security
posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide
remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders._

The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:
- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF)
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements
